In July 2015 I left a career as a Chemistry Teacher at a top UK boarding school. This was not becuase I didn't enjoy it, in fact quite on the contrary I love teaching and would highly reccommend anyone to try it, but because I wanted to try something a little different.
As a teacher you spend a lot of time helping your students to learn a concept in order that they can do something with it. With the amount of time you can dedicate to ensure your students are receiving the most advantageous instruction, you end up with very little time to do anything for yourself.
In the end I found that I would hunt out challenging Chemistry problems to do myself in my spare time and it struck me that perhaps it might be fun to do this sort of problem solving as a job.

I was introduced to programming by my brother via codecademy. I spent some time doing the HTML and CSS courses and found an immense sense of satisfaction in doing the exercises and seeing the results produced. The joys of the 'all-knowing' internet meant that soon enough my facebook feed was filled with adverts from coding schools: General Assembly (GA), Makers Academy and many more online courses. After reading the promotional material on their sites, I found myself visiting the GA and Makers Academy campuses of an evening to find out more.
To cut a long story short, I ended up signing up to the Web Development (WDI) course at GA and was ready and raring to go come the start date in September 2016.

(Why did I choose GA over Maker's Academy? Ermmm...like choosing a house to rent, someplaces feel right and others less right. Why this is the case could be analysed and rationally explained but I guess it is what is commonly known as is going with your gut feeling.)

General Assembly was great. It was intense and demanding and as a consequence incredibly fun and rewarding. Every day you were challenged, every day you learnt something new, every day it inspired. Overall, it was 3 months where my creativity, logic and perserverance were pushed. It was 3 months of huge productivity, of solving logical problems and of imagining and creating exciting ideas.

After the 3 months were up at GA it was time to look for a job and following the GA 'Meet & Hire' event, I was lucky enough to have a number of interviews and in the space of two weeks I had accepted a job at a small agency. It was to be the start of something new and exciting again!

Or so I thought.

After a month, my initial enthusiasm and optimism had completely dissappeared. This was for a number of reasons* which I won't detail here but put simply, this was not what I had given my teaching job up for and was not what GA had led me to believe the coding world could offer.

(*I must state that one of the reasons was not the people, all of whom were terribly nice.)

I made the decision to stay, beleiving that it may get better with time, and indeed though I felt a bit more comfortable and some more interesting work came my way, nothing really changed. 

So what to do?

The enthusiasm and optimisim I initially felt would not return on it's own; it was clear that I needed to take matters back into my own hands and re-define my path. I needed to start experimenting, learning and making things again with interesting technologies that I enjoyed. I needed to start having fun coding again.

This brings us from the then to the now. To help the journey back to coding-delight, I've decided to write about all that I'm doing. I believe that documenting my progress will help to keep track of what I have done and benefit the planning of what to do next. It may even, in the future, help someone who finds themselves in a similar situation to me.

Initial ideas of technologies to learn and play with:

###Front end frameworks

- AngularJS 1.x

Something I've played with at GA and at my current job. I have a much better understanding of it now but the standard of code needs to improve- the johnpapa style guide seems a good resource as well as the thinkster.io tutorial.

---
- AngularJS 2

Only released and still undergoing improvements, it utilises web components which look to be the way forward. Typescript looks to be necessary to really leverage it's power so this is something that will need to learnt along the way. Some useful resources for this are:

- thinkster.io, converting to Angular 2
- AngularJS 2 quick start guide and tutorial (can optionally be done in Typescript)
- Learn EcmaScript2015 tutorial with Babel. Though this is for ES6, Typescript is essentialy a super-version of this so worth completeting.

- Vue.js

Another front-end framework that utilises web components. Whilst waiting for Angular 2 this could be a good way to get some more experience (it is also meant to be  easier to get to grips with than React)

###Build tools

- Gulp. I've done a bit of this already but it would be good to experiement further. (Sorry Grunt).

###CSS

- Sass. Again I've done a fair bit of this but it would good to improve the quality of the code I am writing.

- InuitCSS. This looks an interesting style framework... it does a lot of the structural elements of css without affecting the design (like bootstrap). It's modular so you can use as much or as little as you like and is written by Harry the Wizard so you know it is going to be good.

- Bulma.io. A styling framework that uses flexbox. Flexbox is awesome and is garnering modern browser support so could be fun to try out.

- ITCSS. A way to structure your css, by Harry the Wizard. Worth implementing, use alongside the useful BEM naming convetion.

---

###Testing

- A semi-useful introduction to unit testing AngularJS 1.x on thinkster.io tutorial. There is a lot to learn and experiment with here. It's going to take time but can only be done through constant application and practice.

This is just a small list of things to do... I haven't even mentioned webpack/browserify or web-animations (D3 etc.) yet and it seems to be quite overwhelming! The important thing to do is try it out when making things of interest and over the coming weeks that is what I plan to do. The next post will detail where I've decided to start and how I'm going about it.
